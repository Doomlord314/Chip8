# Chip-8 Emulator
-----------
I was bored one day, so I decided to make the entire Chip-8 interpreter for fun, with the end goal of putting it through WebAssembly and putting it on a website.

## Using it
I based my code mostly off of [this guys documentation](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM) with some extra information found on wikipedia
